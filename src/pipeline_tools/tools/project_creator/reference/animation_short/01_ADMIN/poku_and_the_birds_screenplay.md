## FADE IN

### EXT. FOREST TREE — DAY

A crooked TREE TRUNK rises into frame, leafy clumps framing the top.  
On a sturdy BRANCH sits a LARGE NEST cradling THREE BABY BIRDS. They bob and gape their beaks in soft, eager chirps.

At the base of the trunk, POKU (small, cloaked, about 30cm tall) sits with knees hugged to their chest, calm eyes turned up toward the nest.

A gentle BREEZE rustles the leaves. POKU'S cloak hem and grass-like hair tufts sway softly.

### CUT TO:

### MID ON NEST — CONTINUOUS

The NEST fills more of frame. The BABY BIRDS twitch and hop, tiny wings flickering.

The MOTHER BIRD FLUTTERS IN from off-screen, landing lightly on the nest's edge. The branch gives a small, natural bounce.

She glances off toward POKU (just out of frame), hesitates for a heartbeat, then relaxes — settling protectively over the BABY BIRDS.

### CUT TO:

### CLOSE ON POKU — CONTINUOUS

POKU'S FACE now fills the frame, the tree and leaves blurred into a soft watercolor wash behind.

POKU watches the nest above with wide, gentle eyes. After a quiet beat, POKU tilts their head slightly and lets a small, warm smile appear.

A soft BREEZE passes again, lifting the cloak collar and hair tufts.

The CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN on POKU'S peaceful expression, holding the calm connection between POKU and the unseen bird family above.
