## 1.3 Project Intent

This piece is a love letter to Edgar Valter's *Pokuraamat* — capturing the quiet magic of his illustrations in motion. The goal is not to modernize or reinterpret, but to honor the original spirit: gentle, warm, connected to nature.

The animation should feel like a living illustration — as if Valter's drawings began to breathe.

## 1.4 Audience

All ages. The piece should resonate with:
- Estonian audiences familiar with Pokuraamat
- International viewers discovering the world for the first time
- Anyone who appreciates gentle, handcrafted animation

## 1.5 Success Criteria

The animation succeeds if:
- It feels like it belongs in Valter's world
- The emotion reads clearly (peace → surprise → warmth)
- The handmade quality is preserved at 4K
- Viewers want to watch it again

# 2. STORY & CONCEPT

## 2.1 The Moment

This is not a narrative with conflict — it's a **moment of being**. A small creature exists peacefully in nature. Something small happens. The creature responds with innocent wonder.

The story is:
1. Stillness
2. Interruption
3. Acceptance

That's it. No danger, no lesson, no message beyond: *it's nice to notice small things*.

## 2.2 Beat Structure

| Beat | Frames | Time | Description |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 1–24 | 0:00–1:00 | **Stillness** — Poku at rest, breathing softly, eyes peaceful |
| 2 | 25–48 | 1:00–2:00 | **Approach** — A leaf drifts into frame from above |
| 3 | 49–72 | 2:00–3:00 | **Contact** — Leaf lands softly on Poku's head, settles into grass-hair |
| 4 | 73–96 | 3:00–4:00 | **Reaction** — Eyes glance upward, brow shifts, curious confusion |
| 5 | 97–120 | 4:00–5:00 | **Acceptance** — Expression softens into gentle smile, held |

## 2.3 Emotional Arc

```
Peace → Curiosity → Warmth
```

The audience should feel:
- **Beat 1:** Calm, meditative
- **Beat 2–3:** Gentle anticipation
- **Beat 4:** Mild surprise, amusement
- **Beat 5:** Warmth, satisfaction

## 2.4 What This Is NOT

- Not comedic slapstick
- Not dramatic or tense
- Not ironic or subversive
- Not fast-paced
- Not trying to be "cool"

---

# 3. TONE & THEMES

## 3.1 Core Tone

**Gentle. Quiet. Warm. Unhurried.**

Imagine sitting in a forest in early autumn. Soft light. No sounds except wind and distant birds. You notice a small creature nearby, unbothered by your presence. You watch. It does something small. You smile.

That's the tone.

## 3.2 Thematic Pillars

### Nature Connection
Pokus are born from the bog. They are not separate from nature — they are nature. The animation should feel organic, like the movement of plants and water.

### Innocence
Pokus experience the world with childlike openness. There is no cynicism, no fear, no agenda. Just pure response to stimulus.

### Small Moments
Valter's work celebrates the unremarkable. A leaf falling is not a dramatic event — but it's worth noticing. The animation should make "nothing happening" feel meaningful.

### Harmony
No conflict. The leaf doesn't threaten the Poku. The Poku doesn't fight the leaf. Everything coexists.

## 3.3 Mood References

Think of:
- The quiet moments in Studio Ghibli films (not the action)
- The pace of *The Red Turtle*
- The stillness of nature documentaries
- The feeling of Valter's original illustrations

## 3.4 What to Avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Snappy timing | Feels modern/commercial, not Valter |
| Exaggerated reactions | Pokus are gentle, not cartoon characters |
| Ironic detachment | This is sincere, not self-aware |
| Visual clutter | Simplicity is the point |
| Darkness or threat | This world is safe |

# 4. VISUAL STYLE GUIDE

## 4.1 Style North Star

**The animation should look like Edgar Valter drew every frame.**

This means:
- Hand-drawn line quality with organic imperfection
- Soft, rounded forms with no hard edges
- Muted earth-tone palette
- Painterly texture, not flat digital color
- Visible brushwork and line variation

## 4.2 Line Quality

### Characteristics
- **Organic** — Lines breathe, vary in weight, taper at ends
- **Soft** — No sharp corners or mechanical precision
- **Confident** — Not scratchy or hesitant, but loose
- **Imperfect** — Slight wobble is desirable, not a flaw

### Line Weight
- Heavier lines (3–5px at 4K) for outer silhouettes
- Lighter lines (1–2px) for inner details
- Tapering at line endpoints
- Thicker at points of pressure/weight

### What to Avoid
- Perfectly uniform line weight
- Vector-clean precision
- Sharp corners
- Overly sketchy/messy lines

## 4.3 Shape Language

### Poku Forms
- **Round** — Circles, ovals, soft curves
- **Organic** — Asymmetrical, slightly lumpy
- **Soft** — No points, no angles
- **Grounded** — Low center of gravity, stable

### Environment Forms
- **Flowing** — Curves that lead the eye
- **Layered** — Depth through overlapping soft shapes
- **Natural** — Based on real bog/forest forms

### Prop Forms (Leaf)
- **Simple** — Readable silhouette
- **Organic** — Slightly irregular edges
- **Lightweight** — Thin, delicate feeling

## 4.4 Texture

### Surface Treatment
- Subtle paper grain over entire image
- Soft color variation within shapes (not perfectly flat)
- Painterly brushwork visible in backgrounds
- Character lines may have slight texture

### Texture Sources
- Scanned watercolor paper
- Colored pencil texture
- Soft pastel grain

### Application
- Background: Most textured (painted feel)
- Character: Moderate texture (drawn feel)
- Compositing: Light paper overlay unifies everything

## 4.5 Level of Detail

### Background
- Soft, impressionistic
- Large shapes, minimal detail
- Atmospheric perspective (distant = lighter, less saturated)
- Should not compete with character

### Character (Poku)
- More defined than background
- Clear silhouette readable at any size
- Simple features, maximum expression
- Grass-hair has flow but not individual strand detail

### Props (Leaf)
- Simple shape, clear color
- Enough detail to read as "leaf"
- Not botanically accurate

## 4.6 Visual Hierarchy

```
Poku (sharpest, most saturated)
    ↓
Leaf (clear but secondary)
    ↓
Background (softest, most muted)
```

The eye should always go to the Poku first.

# 5. CHARACTER GUIDE

## 5.1 What is a Poku?

Pokus are the spirits of bog mounds (*poku* in Estonian). In Valter's world, they are living creatures — the grass that grows on bog mounds is actually their hair.

They are:
- Born from the bog
- Childlike but ancient
- Peaceful and curious
- Connected to nature
- Solitary but friendly

## 5.2 Physical Description

### Body
- Small, round, soft form
- Earthy brown/tan coloring (like peat)
- Proportions: Large head, small body
- No visible neck
- Short, stubby limbs (if shown)
- Low to the ground

### Face
- Simple, dot-like eyes (dark)
- Small mouth (often just a line)
- Minimal features, maximum expression
- Face positioned low on head (large forehead for grass-hair)

### Grass-Hair
- Golden-green to yellow coloring
- Flows from top of head down past body
- Moves like grass in wind (secondary motion)
- Texture: Individual strands suggested, not detailed

### Size Reference
- Approximately the size of a small melon
- Leaf should be roughly 1/3 to 1/2 the size of Poku's head

## 5.3 Character Proportions & Measurements

**For Model Sheet Development:**

### Head-to-Body Ratio
- **2:1** — Head is approximately twice the size of the body
- Head: ~60-65% of total height
- Body: ~35-40% of total height

### Overall Height
- Approximately 30-50cm when standing (if applicable)
- In seated/resting pose: ~25-35cm tall
- Use proportional units for scaling (e.g., 8 heads tall system not applicable; think 2.5 total units)

### Feature Placement
- **Eyes:** Positioned in lower third of head
- **Eye size:** Small, approximately 1/10th of head width each
- **Eye spacing:** Slightly wider than one eye-width apart
- **Mouth:** Very small, positioned just below eyes
- **Grass-hair origin:** Top 70% of head mass

### Grass-Hair Dimensions
- **Length:** 1.5x to 2x the total body height
- **Volume:** Tapers from wide at crown to flowing at tips
- **Coverage:** 360° around top of head, thickest at center

### Body Mass
- **Width:** Approximately equal to head width at widest point
- **Shape:** Soft oval, slightly wider at base (grounded feeling)
- **Limbs (if visible):** Very short, stubby, minimal detail

## 5.4 Personality

### Core Traits
- **Gentle** — Soft in all responses
- **Curious** — Interested in small things
- **Content** — At peace with existence
- **Innocent** — No cynicism or suspicion
- **Present** — Fully engaged with the moment

### What Poku Is NOT
- Hyperactive or energetic
- Scared or anxious
- Clever or mischievous
- Sarcastic or knowing
- Bored or indifferent

## 5.5 Expression Guide

### Resting/Peaceful (Beat 1)
- Eyes relaxed, perhaps slightly closed
- Mouth neutral or hint of soft smile
- Body settled, breathing visible
- Grass-hair still or gentle sway

### Curious Confusion (Beat 4)
- Eyes shift upward (cross-eyed looking at leaf)
- Brow lifts slightly (if Poku has brow indication)
- Mouth slightly open or pursed
- Head may tilt very slightly
- Body remains mostly still

### Gentle Smile (Beat 5)
- Eyes return to forward, soften
- Mouth curves into small smile
- Overall softening of expression
- Acceptance, not excitement

### Expression Principles
- All expressions should be **subtle**
- Eyes do most of the work
- Less is more — avoid theatrical exaggeration
- Transitions should be slow and gentle

## 5.6 Movement Principles

### Overall Quality
- **Slow** — Pokus move deliberately, never rushed
- **Soft** — No sharp acceleration or stops
- **Grounded** — Weight and connection to earth
- **Organic** — Like plants moving in breeze

### Timing
- Favor ease-in and ease-out
- Long holds with subtle movement (breathing, swaying)
- Reactions are delayed, not instant
- Processing time before response

### Secondary Motion
- Grass-hair follows head movement with delay
- Grass-hair settles slowly after motion stops
- Drag and follow-through essential

### What to Avoid
- Snappy, quick movements
- Instant reactions
- Bouncy/cartoony timing
- Mechanical precision

# 6. PROPS GUIDE

## 6.1 The Leaf

### Leaf Type
- **Generic autumn deciduous leaf** — not botanically specific
- Inspiration: Birch or alder (common in Estonian bogs)
- Simple, recognizable silhouette
- Not overly detailed or realistic

### Physical Properties

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Size | 1/3 to 1/2 of Poku's head width |
| Shape | Oval with gentle serrations |
| Thickness | Very thin, lightweight appearance |
| Stem | Yes, thin delicate stem (~1/4 of leaf length) |

### Color & Texture

- **Secondary/variation:** Warm red (#A65D3F) for shading
- **Texture:** Soft, matte surface (not glossy)
- **Variation:** Subtle color gradation from stem to tip
- **Edges:** Slightly darker/richer color at edges

### Design Notes
- Should feel delicate and fragile
- Simple enough to animate falling/rotating
- Color should stand out against Poku but not clash
- Organic imperfection (slightly asymmetrical)

### Animation Behavior
- Falls in gentle arcs, not straight lines
- May rotate slowly during fall
- Settles with gentle flutter
- Light weight evident in movement

# 7. ENVIRONMENT GUIDE

## 7.1 Setting

**Location:** An autumn bog in southeastern Estonia (Võrumaa)

**Time of Day:** Late afternoon, golden hour approaching

**Season:** Early autumn — leaves turning, warm light, gentle atmosphere

**Weather:** Still, calm, perhaps slight haze

## 7.2 Environment Elements

### Bog Characteristics
- Wet, mossy ground
- Tussock mounds (pokus live on these)
- Standing water suggested but not prominent
- Low-growing vegetation

### Vegetation
- Soft grasses
- Bog moss
- Perhaps distant birch or pine trees (silhouettes)
- Mushrooms optional (very Valter)

### Atmosphere
- Soft, diffused light
- Warm autumn colors
- Slight atmospheric haze
- Peaceful, still air

## 7.3 Background Style

### Treatment
- **Painterly** — Visible brushwork
- **Soft** — No hard edges
- **Simple** — Large shapes, minimal detail
- **Atmospheric** — Sense of depth and air

### Depth Layers
1. **Far Background** — Sky/atmosphere (lightest, most muted)
2. **Mid Background** — Distant trees/hills (soft silhouettes)
3. **Near Background** — Bog environment around Poku
4. **Foreground** — Optional soft frame elements

### What to Avoid
- Sharp detail that competes with character
- Busy patterns or textures
- Strong contrast in background
- Modern or unnatural elements

## 7.4 Environmental Storytelling

The environment should communicate:
- Safety (nowhere feels dangerous)
- Timelessness (could be any era)
- Naturalness (no human presence)
- Stillness (world at rest)

---

# 8. CAMERA & FRAMING

## 8.1 Camera Approach

### Camera Movement
- **Primary approach:** Static camera (locked-off shot)
- **Optional:** Very subtle slow push-in during Beat 5 (final smile)
  - If used: 2-3% scale increase maximum
  - Movement should be nearly imperceptible
  - Emphasizes intimacy of final moment

### Camera Style
- Observational, documentary-like
- Not intrusive or dynamic
- Allows the moment to unfold naturally
- Viewer as gentle witness, not participant

## 8.2 Framing & Composition

### Poku Placement
- **Position:** Slightly off-center (rule of thirds)
- **Vertical:** Lower third to lower half of frame
- **Horizontal:** Center to slightly left or right
- **Reasoning:** Leaves space above for leaf to enter frame

### Composition Guidelines
- **Headroom:** Generous space above Poku for leaf trajectory
- **Looking room:** Slight bias to direction Poku faces
- **Breathing room:** Don't crowd edges with environment detail
- **Balance:** Asymmetrical but harmonious

### Safe Frame Considerations
- Keep Poku's key features (eyes, grass-hair) well within action-safe area
- Account for potential 16:9 to 4:3 cropping (if needed)
- No critical elements in outer 5% of frame

## 8.3 Shot Size

### Classification
- **Medium Close-Up** — Character fills frame comfortably
- Poku should occupy roughly 30-40% of frame height
- Close enough to read expression clearly
- Wide enough to show full grass-hair and leaf fall

### Field of View
- Environment visible but simplified
- Enough context to establish "bog setting"
- Not so wide that character feels lost
- Not so tight that claustrophobic

## 8.4 Visual Flow

### Eye Path
1. Frame opens on Poku (natural resting position for eye)
2. Leaf enters top of frame (draws eye upward)
3. Leaf falls along arc (eye follows)
4. Leaf lands on Poku (returns eye to character)
5. Poku's expression (eye stays on face)

### Composition Notes
- Center of interest always on or near Poku
- Leaf movement creates dynamic within static frame
- Final composition settles with all elements in harmony

# 9. COLOR & LIGHTING

## 9.1 Color Philosophy

Colors should feel:
- **Earthy** — Grounded in nature
- **Warm** — Autumn palette, golden light
- **Muted** — No harsh saturation
- **Harmonious** — Everything belongs together

## 9.2 Color Palette

### Primary Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Poku Body | Warm brown/tan | #A67C52 | Main character body |
| Grass-Hair | Golden green | #B5A642 | Poku's hair |
| Grass-Hair Highlight | Soft yellow | #D4C36A | Hair highlights |
| Eye | Dark brown | #3D2B1F | Simple dot eyes |

### Environment Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Sky | Muted warm grey | #C4B9A8 | Background atmosphere |
| Distant Trees | Soft blue-grey | #7A8B8C | Far silhouettes |
| Bog Ground | Warm ochre | #8B7355 | Ground plane |
| Moss | Muted green | #6B7B5E | Vegetation |

### Accent Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Leaf Primary | Autumn orange | #C87941 | Falling leaf |
| Leaf Secondary | Warm red | #A65D3F | Leaf variation |

### Colors to Avoid
- Pure black (use dark brown instead)
- Pure white (use warm off-white)
- Saturated primaries (no bright red/blue/yellow)
- Cool colors in character (keep Poku warm)

## 9.3 Lighting

### Light Source
- Soft, diffused daylight
- Slightly warm (golden hour approaching)
- Coming from upper frame (suggests sky)
- No harsh shadows

### Shadow Treatment
- Shadows are soft and warm, not dark and cool
- Minimal shadow detail — suggests form, not realism
- Ambient light fills shadows
- No cast shadows unless very soft

### Lighting Mood
- Peaceful, gentle
- Late afternoon warmth
- Soft and even (not dramatic)

## 9.4 Color Consistency

### Frame-to-Frame Rules
- No color shifts between frames (unless intentional lighting change)
- Consistent palette throughout 5 seconds
- Test color at multiple points in animation before finalizing

### Character/Background Relationship
- Poku should be slightly warmer and more saturated than background
- Clear value separation (Poku reads against any background area)
- Background never competes for attention

# 10. ANIMATION PRINCIPLES

## 10.1 Animation Philosophy

**Move like nature, not like cartoons.**

This animation should feel:
- Organic (like plants, water, living things)
- Gentle (nothing jarring or sudden)
- Breathing (always subtle motion, never frozen)
- Handmade (imperfection is character)

## 10.2 Timing & Spacing

### Overall Timing Style
- **Slow and deliberate** — No rushed movements
- **Ease everything** — Soft starts and stops
- **Hold with life** — Static poses still breathe

### Frame Rate Approach
- Animate on 2s (12 drawings per second)
- Use 1s only for very subtle movements (eye darts, small details)
- On 2s suits the handmade, storybook feel

### Spacing Guidelines
- Favor slow-in and slow-out
- Avoid linear spacing (mechanical feeling)
- Arcs in all movement paths
- Asymmetrical timing (nature is irregular)

## 10.3 Core Animation Principles (Applied)

### Squash & Stretch
- Minimal — Poku is soft but not rubbery
- Subtle breathing creates slight expansion/contraction
- Grass-hair can stretch slightly when following motion

### Anticipation
- Very subtle — a small settle before motion
- Eyes may close slightly before opening wide
- Avoid theatrical wind-ups

### Follow-Through & Overlap
- Essential for grass-hair (always follows head with delay)
- Soft settling after any motion stops
- Nothing stops all at once

### Slow In / Slow Out
- Apply to everything
- Movements emerge gradually and settle gradually
- No abrupt starts or stops

### Arcs
- All motion follows organic arcs
- Leaf falls in gentle curve, not straight line
- Eye movement traces subtle arc

### Secondary Action
- Breathing is constant underlying motion
- Grass-hair responds to all head movement
- Small shifts even in "held" poses

### Timing
- Poku thinks slowly — delay between stimulus and response
- Reactions unfold over multiple frames
- Allow audience time to read expressions

### Exaggeration
- Minimal — stay true to gentle source material
- Exaggerate timing (make things slower) not poses
- Subtle expression shifts, not big takes

## 10.4 Specific Animation Notes

### Breathing
- Subtle rise and fall of body
- Continuous throughout (never truly still)
- Cycle of 24–48 frames (1–2 seconds per breath)
- Grass-hair gently sways with breath

### Leaf Fall
- Drifting, not dropping
- Gentle side-to-side float
- Rotation optional (adds complexity)
- Settles softly, doesn't bounce

### Eye Movement
- Eyes move together (no independent eye motion)
- Subtle movement, not darting
- May include soft blink
- Cross-eyed look should be gentle, not extreme

### Expression Change
- Gradual transition over multiple frames
- Start in eyes, spread to rest of face
- Mouth change is last
- Allow time to read each expression before transitioning

## 10.5 Movement Timing Reference

| Action | Frames | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Single breath cycle | 24–48 | Continuous background motion |
| Leaf drift (full fall) | 48 | Slow, floating descent |
| Leaf settle | 12–18 | Soft landing, slight adjustment |
| Eye shift | 8–12 | Gradual, not snappy |
| Blink | 4–6 | Quick but soft |
| Smile formation | 12–18 | Slow emergence |
| Grass-hair delay | 4–6 | Frames behind head motion |
| Grass-hair settle | 12–24 | Slow return to rest |

# 11. SOUND DESIGN

## 11.1 Audio Philosophy

Sound should be:
- **Minimal** — Less is more
- **Natural** — Environmental, not musical
- **Soft** — Nothing harsh or loud
- **Supportive** — Enhances, never dominates

## 11.2 Sound Approach

### Recommended: Ambient + Minimal SFX

Layer 1: **Ambient Bed**
- Soft bog atmosphere
- Gentle wind
- Distant birds (occasional, sparse)
- Very low level, almost subliminal

Layer 2: **Spot Effects**
- Leaf flutter (subtle paper-like rustle)
- Soft breath or hum from Poku (optional)
- Leaf landing (barely audible soft thud)

### Alternative: Silence
Pure silence is also valid. Lets the visuals speak entirely.

## 11.3 What to Avoid

- Music (feels imposed on the moment)
- Cartoon sound effects (bounces, boings)
- Loud or sudden sounds
- Too many layers (keep it sparse)
- Sounds that draw attention to themselves

## 11.4 Audio Specs

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Format | WAV or AIFF |
| Sample Rate | 48kHz |
| Bit Depth | 24-bit |
| Channels | Stereo |

- **Working units:** Pixels at 4K, scale to viewport
- **Grid:** Optional, use for initial layout only

### Stroke Settings
- **Pressure sensitivity:** Enabled for natural line variation
- **Smoothing:** Moderate (3-5 iterations)
- **Stroke stabilization:** Light stabilization for cleaner lines
- **Minimum pressure threshold:** Low (capture subtle strokes)

### Material Setup Approach
- **Line materials:** Separate materials for character, environment, props
- **Fill materials:** Organized by color palette zones
- **Texture materials:** Paper grain overlay, subtle color variation
- **Material naming:** Use PKU prefix (e.g., PKU_char_poku_body_line)

### Layer Organization Strategy

```
LAYERS (top to bottom):
├── FX_overlay (paper texture, final adjustments)
├── CHAR_poku_line (character outlines)
├── CHAR_poku_fill (character color fills)
├── CHAR_poku_hair (grass-hair on separate layer for flexibility)
├── PROP_leaf_line
├── PROP_leaf_fill
├── ENV_near (immediate environment)
├── ENV_mid (middle ground)
└── ENV_far (background/sky)
```

### Drawing Workflow
- **Rough pass:** Sketch layer (deletable)
- **Cleanup pass:** Final line layer
- **Color pass:** Fill layers with texture
- **FX pass:** Overlay texture and atmospheric elements

### Performance Considerations
- Use Onion Skinning (3-5 frames before/after)
- Enable Multiframe editing for held poses
- Organize strokes efficiently (avoid over-complexity)
- Regular file backups during animation
